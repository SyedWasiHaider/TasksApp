****USAGE******

-Use the top navbar to navigate between the listview, the new task view
and the local uw events view.

-You can click on individual events in the listview and see more details
about the event. You can also sort the events by day, next day, week,etc.
Overdue events are shown in red.

-The new task view allows you to add a new task (wow surprise). You the
button beside the address field to show the map and if you click on the
map, the address should be auto-filled into the textbox. If this doesn't
happen, javascript is stupid.

-The uw events view allows you to add events with just one click on the 
heart. Only events happening today or afterwards are shown.
